# 0x00 Python - Variable Annotations

## Overview

The goal of this project was to learn about type annotations in Python 3.8 and how to use them. The project also covered the following topics:

As usual, files prefixed in the tens and units e.g `1-main.py` are mandatory tasks while those prefixed in the hundreds e.g `101-square_matrix_map.py` are advanced tasks.
