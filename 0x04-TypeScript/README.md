# JavaScript - TypeScript

## Overview

A series of programs to understand Typescript for backend development.

The project is divided into five directories, with each subdirectory a full problem set with increasing complexity from the previous ones.

As usual, files prefixed in the tens and units e.g `1-main.js` are mandatory tasks while those prefixed in the hundreds e.g `101-square_matrix_map.js` are advanced tasks.
